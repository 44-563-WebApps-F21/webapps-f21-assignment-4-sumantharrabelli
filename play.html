    <h3> Same as Act I.(Morning-room in Lord Windermere’s
        house) </h3>
    <p>
        <br> Lying on sofa
        <br>

        ROSALIE. Did your ladyship ring for me?
        <br>
        LADY WINDERMERE. Yes. Have you found out at what time Lord Windermere
        came in last night?
        <br>
        ROSALIE. His lordship did not come in till five o’clock.
        <br>
        LADY WINDERMERE. Five o’clock? He knocked at my door this morning,
        didn’t he?
        <br>
        ROSALIE. Yes, my lady—at half-past nine. I told him your ladyship was
        not awake yet.
        <br>
        LADY WINDERMERE. Did he say anything?
        <br>
        ROSALIE. Something about your ladyship’s fan. I didn’t quite catch what
        his lordship said. Has the fan been lost, my lady? I can’t find it, and
        Parker says it was not left in any of the rooms. He has looked in all of
        them and on the terrace as well.
        <br>

        LADY WINDERMERE. It doesn’t matter. Tell Parker not to trouble. That
        will do.
        <br>

        LADY WINDERMERE. [_Rising_.] She is sure to tell him. I can fancy a
        person doing a wonderful act of self-sacrifice, doing it spontaneously,
        recklessly, nobly—and afterwards finding out that it costs too much. Why
        should she hesitate between her ruin and mine? . . . How strange! I
        would have publicly disgraced her in my own house. She accepts public
        disgrace in the house of another to save me. . . . There is a bitter
        irony in things, a bitter irony in the way we talk of good and bad women.
        . . . Oh, what a lesson! and what a pity that in life we only get our
        lessons when they are of no use to us! For even if she doesn’t tell, I
        must. Oh! the shame of it, the shame of it. To tell it is to live
        through it all again. Actions are the first tragedy in life, words are
        the second. Words are perhaps the worst. Words are merciless. . . . Oh!
        [_Starts as_ LORD WINDERMERE _enters_.]
        <br>
        LORD WINDERMERE. [_Kisses her_.] Margaret—how pale you look!
        <br>
        LADY WINDERMERE. I slept very badly.
        <br>
        LORD WINDERMERE. [_Sitting on sofa with her_.] I am so sorry. I came
        in dreadfully late, and didn’t like to wake you. You are crying, dear.
        <br>
        LADY WINDERMERE. Yes, I am crying, for I have something to tell you,
        Arthur.
        <br>
